# Shelly Services
A very early attempt to include shelly service items in home assistant for admin use

USE AT YOUR OWN RISK !!!

Some examples:

This custom component will add a couple of entities to your shelly devices including

- Authentication switch
- IP address
- Connectivity Config (unicast for gen1 and websocket for Gen2+ devices

## This software has been made in cooperation with artificial intelligence.

This is a proof of concept, it does work but it is likely to break or malfunction

I would love to see real minds take this to the next level
